### Description

Linear Barcodes is the second part to my Bacode submissions. As with the EAN barcodes, this a DLL that programmers and delvelopers can use to add bar-coding functionality to their applications. Just add the reference to the DLL, set a few proporties and you're away. See the document file and demo program for more details on using it. Enjoy. Vote if you like it but would prefer some feed back.
